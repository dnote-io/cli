## Overview

We learn new things everyday while programming. And we forget most of them exponentially because don't write them down.

Dnote is designed for writing technical notes without switching context from programming. You can capture your learning as they happen with no overhead.

## Commands

Please refer to [commands](/COMMANDS.md).
