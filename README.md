[Dnote](https://www.getdnote.com) is a lightweight personal knowledge base. The main design goal is to **keep you focused** by providing a way of swiftly capturing new information **without having to switch environment**. To that end, you can use Dnote as a command-line interface, browser extension, web client, or an IDE plugin.

It also offers a seamless **multi-device sync**, and **automated spaced repetition** to retain your memory. For more information, please see [features](https://www.getdnote.com/pricing).

* It automates spaced repetition to help you retain your memory.
