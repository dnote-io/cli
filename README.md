## Install

On Linux or macOS, run:

    curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dnote/cli/master/install.sh | sh

In some cases, you might need an elevated permission:

    curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dnote/cli/master/install.sh | sudo sh

On Windows, download [binary](https://github.com/dnote/cli/releases).

## Overview

Write technical notes without getting distracted from programming. The reasons are:

* We forget exponentially unless we write down what we learn and come back.
* Ideas cannot be grokked unless we can put them down in clear words.

## Examples

- Add a note to a book named `linux`

```
$ dnote add linux -c "find - recursively walk the directory"
```

- See the notes in a book

```
$ dnote ls linux
â€¢ on book linux
(0) find - recursively walk the directory
```

## Commands

Please refer to [commands](/COMMANDS.md).
